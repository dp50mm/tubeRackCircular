Pretty much every dimension of the tube rack can be parametrically changed.

To use:

step 1: set the parameters the way you want it.

step 2: save the file, this updates the visual.

step 3: Click on render and wait for it to be finished
(this step is necessary, otherwise it exports a previous version for some reason)

step 4: Export as SVG

step 5: Use Illustrator to simplify the shapes, otherwise the lasercut file has weird point errors.
(Object > Path > Simplify)

step 6: Save as CS2 with all the checkboxes turned off for export towards the lasercutter.
